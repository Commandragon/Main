            <h2 class="story-title">Finding His Voice</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Danny Glebus, a determined 9th grader at Two Rivers High School, stared at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Fresh into high school life, he ran a hand through his ginger hair. His freckles shone like tiny constellations on his pale face—a unique look that set him apart, though he never gave it much thought beyond style. Unaware of any hidden origins or whispered rumors, Danny simply accepted himself as he was, with all his quirks and questions.</p>
                
                <p>He splashed water on his face, trying to wash away not just the sleepiness of a new school year but also the quiet uncertainty about who he might become. “I’m not a mistake,” he murmured, more as a gentle reminder than a declaration of defiance. His hands—adept at both strumming a guitar and shaping wood in the workshop—clutched the sink’s edge as the bell signaled the end of lunch and the start of another unpredictable freshman period.</p>
                
                <p>In the busy hallway, Danny nearly bumped into James, another 9th grader. Adjusting his thick-rimmed glasses and carefully balancing a stack of textbooks, James offered a soft, reserved smile. “Hey, watch it,” he said quietly. “Still on for woodshop later?”</p>
                
                <p>Danny nodded. Woodshop had quickly become his sanctuary—a place where the raw potential of a freshman could be carved into something meaningful. Along with James and the ever-casual Illidan, they found solace in the gentle hum of carving tools and the comforting scent of sawdust.</p>
                
                <p>"I'll be there," Danny confirmed. "Is Illidan coming?"</p>
                
                <p>"He might drop by," James replied in his soft-spoken manner. "He's taking things easy these days, enjoying the calm instead of chasing big competitions."</p>
                
                <p>Before Danny could reply further, Maribel approached from the art wing. A seasoned 11th grader with an unmistakable creative spark, she carried herself with quiet confidence. Her arm, decorated with band names scrawled in marker—with “Nirvana” prominently among them—caught his eye, a nod to the music they both secretly admired.</p>
                
                <p>"Hey, Danny," she said with a gentle smile. "Are you going to be in woodshop later? I could really use some help with my project."</p>
                
                <p>James offered a small, knowing nod from a distance—a silent encouragement that hinted at unspoken support. Danny couldn’t help but wonder if Maribel’s visits to woodshop meant more than just art projects.</p>
                
                <p>"Yeah, I'll be there," Danny replied, eyeing the small paper bag in her hand. "What's that?"</p>
                
                <p>Maribel’s smile deepened as she reached into the bag. "I found this and thought of you." She revealed a small metal star pendant. "For your collection."</p>
                
                <p>Danny accepted the gift, already proud of the assortment of pendants that marked his journey of self-discovery. "Thanks, it's perfect."</p>
                
                <p>As Maribel walked away, James gently nudged Danny. "Maybe someday you’ll ask her out," he said softly, his tone reflective rather than teasing.</p>
                
                <p>"I don't know," Danny murmured, turning the new pendant over in his fingers. "I have a lot to figure out."</p>
                
                <p>---</p>
                
                <p>That afternoon in woodshop, Danny lost himself in the rhythmic task of sanding a small wooden box he was crafting. The smooth, even strokes of the sandpaper and the grain of the wood spoke to him—a blend of precision and creative freedom that resonated deeply. Surrounded by fellow freshmen still finding their way, the woodshop was more than just a class; it was a haven where every chip of wood carried a promise of possibility.</p>
                
                <p>Maribel worked at a nearby bench, her occasional glances warm and encouraging. James, quietly observant as ever, alternated between sketching ideas for a shelf and reading a book, his calm presence lending the room an air of understated support.</p>
                
                <p>"There's a talent showcase next month," Maribel mentioned softly, breaking the steady rhythm of their work. "You should sign up."</p>
                
                <p>Danny snorted lightly. "Right. That's exactly what someone who doubts himself should do—get on stage and prove them wrong."</p>
                
                <p>"Don't say that," she countered gently. "I've heard you sing when you think no one's listening."</p>
                
                <p>Danny's cheeks warmed. "It's not really singing—it feels like just noise sometimes."</p>
                
                <p>"It's not noise," James added quietly from his corner, his soft voice filled with unexpected warmth. "It’s uniquely yours—gritty and soulful in its own way."</p>
                
                <p>"Well, maybe I just need to try," Danny conceded, a small smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                <p>"Just think about it," Maribel said, stepping a bit closer. "Everyone expects you to fit a certain mold, but maybe being different means you’re something entirely new."</p>
                
                <p>The words mingled with the scent of sawdust and possibility, echoing softly in the gentle hum of the workshop.</p>
                
                <p>---</p>
                
                <p>That evening, rather than walking home alone, Danny found himself strolling beside Maribel. Their measured pace mirrored the uncertainties and discoveries of freshman year.</p>
                
                <p>"Why do you like woodworking?" she asked softly, breaking the comfortable silence.</p>
                
                <p>Danny thought for a moment. "There’s a logic in the grain, the angles, and the finish. But there's also a kind of freedom—the wood seems to suggest its own design, and you just follow along. It’s both precise and creative, like carving out your own path."</p>
                
                <p>Maribel nodded. "That’s exactly how I feel about your voice."</p>
                
                <p>Danny paused, a little surprised. "What do you mean?"</p>
                
                <p>"Your voice is steady and true. It doesn’t try to imitate anyone else—it’s just yours, and that’s something special," she replied softly.</p>
                
                <p>Later that night, alone in his room, Danny stared at the guitar his parents had once cherished with high hopes. Picking it up, he strummed a tentative melody, letting his fingers explore new patterns. In that quiet moment, the guitar transformed from a relic of expectations into a vessel for his authentic expression.</p>
                
                <p>He wasn’t trying to be anyone else; he was simply Danny Glebus—a 9th-grade freshman learning to find his own voice through music, woodshop, and quiet moments of introspection.</p>
                
                <p>---</p>
                
                <p>The night of the talent showcase arrived sooner than Danny expected. Backstage, his heart pounded as he clutched his guitar—a tool of personal revelation rather than a symbol of any past expectations. Among nervous freshmen, his resolve had grown, nurtured by the gentle encouragement of friends like James and the kind words of Maribel.</p>
                
                <p>James appeared nearby, quietly offering a reassuring nod. "Illidan's around too," he noted softly, referring to their friend who was known more for his relaxed presence than for any grand ambitions.</p>
                
                <p>"Great," Danny replied with a light laugh. "So if I stumble, it'll just be another honest moment in front of everyone."</p>
                
                <p>"You won't," Maribel said as she approached, holding a small sticker that read simply: "Original." She pressed it onto his guitar case. "Remember, being different doesn't mean being less."</p>
                
                <p>When his name was called, Danny stepped onto the stage, the spotlight marking a new chapter in his life. In the audience, he caught sight of his parents’ surprised faces—unaware of his secret determination—and a quiet thumbs-up from Illidan, who was there simply to enjoy the moment.</p>
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Danny began to play. The song, titled "Dissonant Melody," wove together his struggles, dreams, and emerging identity. It wasn’t perfect, and it certainly wasn’t a reflection of any preconceptions about him, but as his gravelly voice filled the auditorium, he realized that being true to himself was what mattered most.</p>
                
                <p>He was Danny Glebus—a 9th grader, a craftsman in woodshop, a quiet friend, and perhaps something more to Maribel—and his melody, however dissonant to some, was unmistakably his own.</p>
